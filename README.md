# Portfoliofy

Assemble screenshots of web projects for your portfolio

## Description

Once a web project is done, it's time to document your hard work and show it off. _Portfoliofy_ makes that process easier by doing all the screenshots for you and assembling them together into portfolio-ready files.

As of v2.0.0, the following files can be generated:

* `SCREENSHOTS`
  * Four image files of screenshots taken in different viewports (desktop - 2160x1360, laptop - 1440x900, tablet - 768x1024, smartphone - 230x490).
* `MAIN`
  * An image file of those screenshots overlaid on top schematic diagrams and then collaged together. (See below for an example ouput.)
* `BROWSER`
  * A image file of the desktop screenshot overlaid on top of a schematic diagram. (Scroll to the bottom for an example ouput.)

More coming soon!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* CairoSVG==2.7.1
* Pillow==10.1.0
* Requests==2.31.0
* selenium==4.15.2

### Usage

Clone it!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggeerraarrdd/portfoliofy.git
```

Open `local_settings.py` and change the value of `url` to the one you want to portfoliofy.

Then run the following command:

```bash
python portfoliofy.py
```

The output files are stored in a subdirectory of the `output` directory.

## Parameters

You can also change the following parameter in `local_settings.py`.

| Parameter         | Type   | Default value | Value range  | Description |

| wait              | int    | 2             | 0-60         | Time in seconds to allow URL to load before taking screenshot. |

The `MAIN` and `BROWSER` output files are generated by default but you can stop this default behavior by changing the value of `request` to `False`. You can also customize the output files.
